My name is Julia Silge and I live in Salt Lake City, UT. I love the mountains, the climate, and my community here. I studied physics and astronomy, finishing my PhD in 2005. During my years in astronomy, I developed near-infrared techniques for measuring how stars in galaxies are moving, modeled supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, and participated in searches for Kuiper belt objects in our own solar system. Over my whole career, I have been active in teaching and communicating about STEM with non-expert audiences. I also have worked for an ed tech company writing astronomy content for the higher ed classroom. Now, I work in data science where my background in astronomy, physics, and education has given me a strong foundation for using data to answer interesting questions.
